# WOMAP (Womens's Safety Route Companion)

# Abstract
Women’s safety during travel continues to be a major concern, especially in unfamiliar or poorly lit areas. Many people feel anxious when walking alone or using public transport at night because there are limited tools that focus on personal safety. Existing navigation apps mainly show the shortest or fastest routes but do not consider how safe those routes are.
The Women’s Safe Enroute Companion project aims to solve this problem by creating a smart and easy to use platform that helps women choose safer routes when travelling. The system provides route suggestions based on the factors like past safety incidents, lighting conditions and nearby public spaces. It also allows users to share their live location with trusted contacts, send emergency alerts and report unsafe situations to help others stay informed.
The main goal of this project is to build a supportive and reliable companion that increase women’s confidence while travelling. By raising awareness and encouraging community participation, the project hopes to make daily travel safer and more comfortable for women everywhere.


# Goal

The main goals of the **Women’s Safe Route Companion** project are:

- To enhance the safety and confidence of women while traveling.  
- To provide real time safe route suggestions based on crime data, lighting conditions and user reports.  
- To enable users to make informed travel decisions through an interactive and user friendly interface.  
- To offer real time safety alerts and live location tracking for emergency situations.  
- To allow users to report incidents, contributing to community driven safety improvements.  
- To utilize modern technologies like FastAPI, React.js, PostgreSQL and mapping APIs for a secure and scalable solution.  
- To promote community awareness and safer urban mobility for women.
